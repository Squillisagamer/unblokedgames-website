    <p1><center> Hello gamers! We are currently trying to get out website into an HTML type website. Right now, we are trying to learn the basics of HTML and how we can use it to create an awesome gaming website. We are probably going to make the website by the end of 2023 because we are still learning how to code in HTML. But, if we can, we may release a sloppy version sooner than the end of 2023 so you guys have a better experience playing games. Speaking of better experience, if you guys see any bugs or issues on the website, please report it and we will try our best to fix it. Thank you for picking our website!
        
        Yours truly,
        
        William V and Paxton U.</center></p1>
